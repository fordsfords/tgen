# tgen - Traffic generator

Utility functions to assist in the creation of a traffic generator.

# Introduction

This is a "little language" processor to assist in the construction of a network traffic generator.

The tgen module is not actually a traffic generator.
It is an API to make it easier to write a flexiable,
easy-to-use traffic generator.
It is an "orchestrator".

An real traffic generator based on tgen is at:
https://github.com/UltraMessaging/um_tgen

To document tgen would involve duplicating most of the documentation in um_tgen.
Since I don't expect this module to become wildly popular -
um_tgen will likely be the only tool to use tgen -
I won't bother documenting tgen here.
See https://github.com/UltraMessaging/um_tgen for
documentation.
