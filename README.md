# Introduction

This is a "little language" processor to assist in the construction of a network traffic generator.

## Little Langues Considered Harmful?

Little languages have been [promoted](http://staff.um.edu.mt/afra1/seminar/little-languages.pdf) and
[criticized](https://3e8.org/pub/scheme/doc/Universal%20Scripting%20Framework%20(Lambda%20as%20little%20language).pdf).

I'm generally skeptical of them (do we really need yet another language?),
and I've talked myself out of writing them on several occasions.

But not this time. :-)
